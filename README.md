# Synopsis

This project is dedicated to simplifying Solid State Devices Course calculation.

User interface is based on HTML and Bootstrap, and computational functions are achieved by Javascript. Users can easily compute most of the parameters of P-N junction, MOS capacitor, MOSFET, and PN Diode. 


====================

###PN Junction:

Diffusivity, Electric Field, Built-in potential, Current Density, Resistivity, Xp,Xn,Xd, Capacitance.

Mobility Curve is attached. 

User can copy current calculation results and view history calculation results

=====

###MOS capacitor:

Faltband Voltage, Threshold Voltage,  Xd0, Xd, Cox, Cb, Cdtotoal.

=====

###MOSFET:

Region of Operation, Id, Output Conductance.

=====

###PN Diode:

Built-in Potential, Lp, Ln, Xp, Xn, Xd, Cj0, Cj, Cd, I0, Id, gd, transit Time.

=====

###Uni Converter:

cm <-> mm <-> nm

=====



#####NOTE:

Samples are at 300K in the dark, assuming the depletion approximation for p-n junctions, and the inversion approximation for MOS capacitors.All raw data can be found in console.
